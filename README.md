## Introduction

A simple Golang webapp to get currency exchange information.

## Getting Started

### One-Time
```shell
# Ensure you have asdf installed
# TODO check that all tools have default plugins available
asdf install

# TODO find a decent way to include task in asdf and get autocomplete scripts working
brew install go-task/tap/go-task

# TODO add this to setup task (extra credit: cross platform?)
# this is needed for sponge https://linux.die.net/man/1/sponge
brew install moreutils

# Install jsonnet external libraries
# TODO ensure this is a dependency on all jsonnet tasks
task jb:install
```

```shell
task run
```

In a separate shell

```shell
task http:metrics
```

### Configuration

Configuration is done via environment variables. Standard AWS SDK Environment variables supported, as well as OIDC/EC2 authentication methods.

| Variable       | Required | Default | Description                                                    |
|----------------|----------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `APP_TBD`      | no       | ``      | Just an example unused environment variable                    |
| `PORT`         | no       | `8080`  | The listen port                                                |
| `BIND_ADDRESS` | no       |         | Configured to listen on 127.0.0.1, this may not work in Docker |

## Roadmap

- [ ] Make a roadmap

### Known Issues

1. 
2. 
3. There's a slew of app optimizations still left, such as separating `/ping` and `/metrics` endpoints onto different listeners, make logging configurable between text/color and JSON and some other things. This was my first time using Gin.
4. I didn't configure test coverage or pay attention to that much. Just wrote a few small unit tests and a sanity-check end2end test (just verifies that the app runs and I can /ping it) via docker-compose.
