## Introduction

A simple Golang webapp to get currency exchange information.

## Getting Started

### One-Time
```shell
# Ensure you have asdf installed
# brew install asdf

# TODO check that all tools have default plugins available
asdf plugin-add task https://github.com/particledecay/asdf-task.git
asdf plugin-add tanka
asdf plugin-add k3d

asdf install

# TODO add this to setup task (extra credit: cross platform?)
# this is needed for sponge https://linux.die.net/man/1/sponge
brew install moreutils

# Install jsonnet external libraries
# TODO ensure this is a dependency on all jsonnet tasks
task jb:install
```

```shell
task run
```

In a separate shell

```shell
task http:metrics
```

### Testing Via Docker-Compose

```shell
task test:integration
```

### Deploying to K3D

```shell
# TODO combine these
task k3d:create

# NOTE: registry up prints a message to update /etc/hosts
# This is not done automatically, as that is a system-wide change 
# that I feel is something the user should handle
# TODO investigate using dnsmasq or something else to prevent this requirement

task publish:k3d
task tk:apply -- environments/default
task test:integration:k3d
```

### Configuration

Configuration is done via environment variables.

| Variable       | Required | Default | Description                                                    |
|----------------|----------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `APP_TBD`      | no       | ``      | Just an example unused environment variable                    |
| `PORT`         | no       | `8080`  | The listen port                                                |
| `BIND_ADDRESS` | no       |         | Configured to listen on 127.0.0.1, this may not work in Docker |

## Roadmap

- [x] Add Kubernetes Manifests (ideally this is put in a separate repo)
- [x] Add K3D Support
- [ ] Add Github Actions CI/CD
- [ ] See TODO üîç comments all around... 

### Known Issues

1. There's a slew of app optimizations still left, such as separating `/ping` and `/metrics` endpoints onto different listeners (separate for application endpoints), make logging configurable between text/color and JSON and some other things. This was my first time using Gin.
2. I didn't configure test coverage or pay attention to that much. Just wrote a few small unit tests and a sanity-check end2end test (just verifies that the app runs, I can /ping it, and a small assertion of the expected output) via docker-compose and k3d.
3. go and jsonnet/jb/tanka fight over the `vendor` directory. This is somewhat fixed with `-mod=readonly` or `-mod=mod` as an explicit flag to go commands, or `GOFLAGS=-mod=mod`, however, Jetbrains GOLAND still has problems if the `vendor` directory exists and doesn't have go files in it. See https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/GO-10952/No-way-to-disable-vendoring-for-Sync-Dependencies-quick-fix. To get Goland to not freak out, `rm -rfd vendor`. This of course breaks all the Jsonnet, so when you are ready to do anything else, run `task jb:install`. Another possible way to fix this is if tanka supported other vendor directories. See https://github.com/grafana/tanka/issues/356 and https://github.com/grafana/tanka/issues/820.  
4. When making changes to `taskfile.jsonnet` there's a really painful loop of:
   1. copy the vars block (because of the issue with ordering in a map). 
   2. run `task taskfile:gen`
   3. paste the vars block (optionally: if changes to vars were made, make sure those are captured)
   4. run `task <blah>` (whatever it is what I was working on at the time)

   Solution: When I first found Taskfile, I really liked it, but it turns out to not really be as flexible or intuitive as I prefer. I started a project called [fngo](https://fngo.dev/) as a replacement for Task, but I'm still in the early stages of really understanding what I want, and how I want to represent it.
